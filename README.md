- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project interests me because, throughout primary and secondary school
I would participate in monthly "pizza lunches", which offered an exciting
change of lunch from the daily bagged lunch. My mother volunteered at these lunches,
 and tells me that it was a long process to keep track of every
order made by a student, as well, the school would have to input a students' order
every month. 

An order-form was given to each student
to bring home to their parents, where they would decide what to order for
"pizza lunch". The student would bring the form back to the school, where
the orders were made individually for every class. **The problem with 
this system was** that students and parents would have to fill a new 
order-form every month for "pizza lunch", often losing
their forms, causing confusion throughout the staff and wasting a lot of time. With the help
of *Food Party*, the school could easily sign in to their account, make minor changes to the
previous order, and order immediately.
