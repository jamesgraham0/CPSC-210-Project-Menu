- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

After passing around ideas for this project I've decided that it would be significantly more rewarding and 
enjoyable to make a game, as it sparks my interests. I was three years old when I mastered the classic side-scroller - Super Mario World on the Super Nintendo.
Since then, I've been obsessed with the Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Wii, Wii U, and now the Nintendo Switch.
The evolution of smartphones has made playing intuitive, quickly completed games extremely common; games
with few controls, and a clear goal are easy to play on a bus ride or while waiting for a friend.
Because of my love for video games and inspiration from the current market of mobile games I've decided
to make *Don't Get Hit*.
